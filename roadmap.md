### **Phase 2: Backend Development**

#### 2.1 Spring Boot for CRUD Operations
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Portfolio Management: Add, Update, Delete stocks.
  - Retrieve user portfolio.
  - Fetch real-time stock data via third-party APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage).
- **Database Schema**:
  - `users`, `stocks`, `portfolios`, `transactions`, `alerts` tables.
- **Security**:
  - Implement JWT for authentication.

#### 2.2 Python AI Service
- **Hugging Face Integration**:
  - Fine-tune GPT-like models for NLP.
  - Provide conversational support for stock-related queries.
- **Groq API Acceleration**:
  - Optimize ML inference for low latency.
- **RESTful APIs**:
  - Expose endpoints for insights and conversational responses.

#### 2.3 Database & Caching
- Optimize PostgreSQL for relational data.
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., real-time stock prices).

#### Deliverables:
- Functional CRUD APIs.
- Python AI service integrated with Hugging Face and Groq API.
- Optimized database with caching layer.

---

### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

#### React.js + Vite Frontend
1. **Portfolio Management UI**:
   - Dashboard for performance, trends, and allocation visualization.
   - Forms for adding/updating stocks.
2. **Chatbot Integration**:
   - Embed a chatbot powered by the Python AI service.
   - Enable real-time interactions using WebSocket.
3. **Notifications**:
   - Integrate toast notifications and alerts for stock updates.
4. **API Integration**:
   - Connect to backend services (Spring Boot, Python).

#### Deliverables:
- Responsive, user-friendly frontend.
- AI-powered chatbot interface.

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**

#### Real-Time Market Data
- Integrate WebSocket in Spring Boot for live stock updates.
- Stream updates to the frontend in real-time.

#### Portfolio Insights
- Compute diversification, risk, and performance metrics in Python.
- Display insights on the dashboard.

#### AI-Driven Recommendations
- Extend Hugging Face models for:
  - Stock suggestions.
  - Risk-adjusted portfolio rebalancing.

#### Deliverables:
- Real-time stock data streaming.
- AI-powered portfolio insights and recommendations.

---

### **Phase 5: Security and Optimization**

#### Security Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Secure API communications with OAuth 2.0 and HTTPS.
- Encrypt sensitive data (at rest and in transit).

#### Performance Optimization
- Scale Spring Boot services with Kubernetes.
- Optimize database queries and caching.
- Leverage Groq API for high-performance AI inference.

#### Deliverables:
- Secure system with 2FA and encryption.
- Scalable backend and optimized AI service.

---

### **Phase 6: Testing and Deployment**

#### Testing
- Unit tests for CRUD operations (JUnit for Java, pytest for Python).
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- UI tests for React frontend (Cypress, Jest).

#### Deployment
- Containerize all services (Docker).
- Orchestrate using Kubernetes.
- Automate CI/CD pipeline for builds, testing, and deployment.

#### Deliverables:
- Fully tested system.
- Automated deployment pipeline.

---

### **Phase 7: Monitoring and Scaling**

#### Monitoring
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring backend services.
- Track frontend errors with Sentry.

#### Scaling
- Implement load balancing for high-traffic scenarios.
- Scale AI inference services using Groq API.

#### Deliverables:
- Fully monitored and scalable system.
